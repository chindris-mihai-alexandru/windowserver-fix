# ShellCheck Configuration
# Matches CI/CD configuration in .github/workflows/shellcheck.yml
#
# Usage: shellcheck *.sh
#   ShellCheck will automatically load this config from the current directory

# Disable SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# Reason: We use variable-based sourcing for config files (e.g., source "$CONFIG_FILE")
disable=SC1090

# Disable SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Reason: Common in config files and forward declarations that are sourced by other scripts
disable=SC2034

# Enable all optional checks for best practices
enable=all

# Set severity threshold to 'error' for consistency with CI
# (Note: This is informational - shellcheck CLI uses -S/--severity flag)
# In CI we use: severity: error (only fails on errors, not warnings)
